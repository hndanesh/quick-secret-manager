# Quick and dirty secret manager
## Why?
When you're stuck with a windows machine with very little access and can't use/don't want to use secret managers

Create files encrypted with a gpg key containing credentials or sensitive information

## Usage

Create a new encrypted file with an autogenerated diceware password in the format
```
secret_file_name.gpg
<username>
<password>

./pass.sh <secret_file_name> <username>
```

Copy a password to clipboard
```
./decrypt <secret_file_name>
```
